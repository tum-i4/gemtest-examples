# GeMTest ðŸ’Ž: Examples

Metamorphic relation examples implemented in ``gemtest``.

To run all metamorphic relations from the 16 program domains 
install Python dependencies with ``poetry``:

``poetry install``

and run metamorphic test suites with:

``poetry run pytest  <options> <path to test file/folder>``

We also prepare poetry commands for running some examples such as:

```
poetry run example simple/test_add.py
poetry run example trigonometry/test_sin.py
poetry run example house_pricing/test_house_pricing.py
poetry run example shortest_path/test_path.py
poetry run example facial_keypoints/test_keypoints.py
poetry run example gtsrb/metamorphic_tests
poetry run example linalg/test_solve.py
```

## Requirements
Currently supported: Python Versions 3.8 - 3.12
- Tested under Ubuntu 20.04 with poetry 1.4.0 and python 3.10.12
- Tested under Windows 11 running WSL2 with poetry 1.5.1 and python 3.10.6 
- Tested under Windows 11 native with poetry 1.5.1 and python 3.10.6
